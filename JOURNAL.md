# June 22: The real start.
I saw [this article](https://www.xda-developers.com/someone-built-split-keyboard-3d-printer-25-dollars/) a few days ago and I thought, why couldn't I do that? I own a 3d printer and it would be fun to make a super cheap keyboard.

So I did. I've seen [the Tiny20](https://github.com/enzocoralc/Tiny20) bouncing around the internet and I think its hilarious. I saw it and I immediately thought, I want one. However, I want to make my own version to fit my hands slightly better.

The original tiny20 is built on a PCB and uses Choc switches. I decided to use MX switches and handwire it with the help of a 3d print. This cuts out a LOT of the cost. Perusing around aliexpress, I found that all the required components comes out to **$20.36**, INCLUDING SHIPPING. The original XDA article for a cheap Corne doesn't include the shipping cost and is $25. I consider this a massive win for my costs.

At the time of writing this section, I've made a very simple design in Ergogen and I plan to turn the PCB into a DXF to import into Onshape and make a handwired case for that I can 3d print.

The current time is 1:14 PM.
